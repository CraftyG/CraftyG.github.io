**Note:** This is an early build of the data pack that uses experimantal features and has not been tested thoroughly, so expect some bugs and issues when using this data pack.

## What It Does
This data pack uses experimental settings (dimension types, worldgen, etc.) to add some difficulty when playing on your Minecraft world.
## How to Set It Up
Download the zip file and place in in your `world/datapacks` folder when creating a new world. If the world is already running, exit the world and go back into that world, as running `reload` won't work.
### Changelog
```diff
1.16.3
+ Beds now explode when using them in the overworld, just like how it works in the Nether.
+ Respawn anchors works the same way as beds, but in the Nether.
* No changes to the End, as it functions so by default.
```
